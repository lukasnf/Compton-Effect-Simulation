19.10.24: Project finished. Still lots of room for improvement:)

What's the purpose of the graph? 
  The graph plots the new wavelength in relation to the scattering angle 'theta'.
  You are able to see the new wavelength at a certain scattering angle. Thought it would be a nice feature. Although, you can easily spot it by looking at the 
  equation. ;)

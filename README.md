# Compton Effect Simulation

This project is an **interactive simulation** of the **Compton Effect**, created using **Pygame**. The Compton Effect describes the scattering of high energy photons by electrons, resulting in a change in the photon's wavelength depending on the scattering angle. This phenomenon is evidence for the particle nature of 
light.

## üñ•Ô∏è Preview

The simulation features:
- visualization of photon-electron collision.
- Real-time calculations of the photon's wavelength and energy after scattering.
- An adjustable slider to control the scattering angle (Œ∏).
- A graph illustrating the relationship between wavelength shift and scattering angle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Particle Simulation**: Models the dynamics of the photon and electron based on physical principles.
- **Adjustable Scattering Angle**: Select a scattering angle between 0¬∞ and 180¬∞ using a slider.
- **Wavelength Shift Visualization**: Displays how the photon's wavelength changes with the scattering angle.
- **Restart Functionality**: Press the spacebar to reset the simulation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pygame**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash 
pip install pygame matplotlib
```

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/compton-effect-simulation.git
   cd compton-effect-simulation
   ```
- Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

#### Have fun :)

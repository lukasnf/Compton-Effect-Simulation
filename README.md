# Compton Effect Simulation

This project is an **interactive simulation** of the **Compton Effect**, created using **Pygame**. The Compton Effect describes the scattering of high energy photons by electrons, resulting in a change in the photon's wavelength depending on the scattering angle. This phenomenon is evidence for the particle nature of 
light.

## 🖥️ Preview

The simulation features:
- visualization of photon-electron collision.
- Real-time calculations of the photon's wavelength and energy after scattering.
- An adjustable slider to control the scattering angle (θ).
- A graph illustrating the relationship between wavelength shift and scattering angle.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Adjustable Scattering Angle**: Select a scattering angle between 0° and 180° using a slider.
- **Wavelength Shift Visualization**: Displays how the photon's wavelength changes with the scattering angle.
- **Button Functionality**: *Space* resets the simulation, *Escape* is used as an initial start button.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pygame**
- **Matplotlib**

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash 
pip install pygame matplotlib
```

### Installation
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukasnf/Compton-Effect-Simulation-Pygame-Physics.git
   cd Compton-Effect-Simulation-Pygame-Physics
   ```
- Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python "Compton Effekt.py"
    ```

#### Have fun :)

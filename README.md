Compton Effect Simulation

This project is an interactive simulation of the Compton Effect, created using Pygame. The Compton Effect describes the scattering of photons (light particles) by electrons, resulting in a change in the photon's wavelength depending on the scattering angle.

🖥️ Preview

The simulation features:

Dynamic visualization of photon-electron collision events.
Real-time calculations of the photon's wavelength and energy after scattering.
An adjustable slider to control the scattering angle (θ).
A graph illustrating the relationship between wavelength shift and scattering angle.
🛠️ Features

Particle Simulation: Models the dynamics of the photon and electron based on physical principles.
Adjustable Scattering Angle: Select a scattering angle between 0° and 180° using a slider.
Wavelength Shift Visualization: Displays how the photon's wavelength changes with the scattering angle.
Restart Functionality: Press the spacebar to reset the simulation.
